# significantdigits package - v0.1.0

Compute the number of significant digits based on the paper [Confidence Intervals for Stochastic Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09655).
This package is also inspired from the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/interflop/stochastic-confidence-intervals/blob/master/Intervals.ipynb) included with the publication.

## Getting started

This synthetic example illustrates how to compute significant digits
of a results sample with a given known reference:

```python
>>> import significantdigits as sig
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from numpy.random import uniform as U
>>> np.random.seed(0)
>>> eps = 2**-52
>>> # simulates results with epsilon differences
>>> X = [1+U(-1,1)*eps for _ in range(10)]
>>> sig.significant_digits(X, reference=1)
>>> 51.02329058847853
```

or with the CLI interface assuming `X` is in `test.txt`:

```bash
    $significantdigits --metric significant -i "$(cat test.txt)" --input-format stdin --reference 1
    (51.02329058847853,)
```

## Installation

```bash
    python3 -m pip install -U significantdigits
```

or if you want the lastest version of the code, you can install from
the repository directly

```bash
    python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/verificarlo/significantdigits.git
    # or if you don't have 'git' installed
    python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/verificarlo/significantdigits/zipball/master
```

## Advanced Usage

### Inputs types

Functions accept the following types for inputs:
```python
    InputType: np.ndarray | tuple | list
```
Those types are accessible with the `get_input_type` function

### Z computation

Metric are computed using Z, the distance
between the samples and the reference.
They are four possible cases depending on the
distance and the nature of the reference
summarize in this table:

|                    | constant reference (x) | random variable reference (Y) |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Absolute precision | Z = X - x              | Z = X - Y                     |
| Relative precision | Z = X/x - 1            | Z = X/Y - 1                   |


```python
compute_z(array: ~InputType, reference: Optional[~ReferenceType], error: significantdigits._significantdigits.Error | str, axis: int, shuffle_samples: bool = False) -> ~InputType
    Compute Z, the distance between the random variable and the reference

    Compute Z, the distance between the random variable and the reference
    with three cases depending on the dimensions of array and reference:

    X = array
    Y = reference
    Three cases:
        - Y is none
            The case when X = Y
            We split X in two and set one group to X and the other to Y
        - X.ndim == Y.ndim
            X and Y have the same dimension
            It it the case when Y is a random variable
        - X.ndim - 1 == Y.ndim or Y.ndim == 0
            Y is a scalar value

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : InputType
        The random variable
    reference : Optional[ReferenceType]
        The reference to compare against
    error : Method.Error | str
        The error function to compute Z
    axis : int, default=0
        The axis or axes along which compute Z
    shuflle_samples : bool, default=False
        If True, shuffles the groups when the reference is None

    Returns
    -------
    array : numpy.ndarray
        The result of Z following the error method choose
```

### Methods

Two methods exist for computing both significant and contributing digits
depending on if the sample follow a Centered Normal distribution or not.
You can pass the method to the function by using the `Method` enum provided by in package. Function also accept the name as a string
`"cnh"` for `Method.CNH` and `"general"` for `Method.General`.

```python
class Method(AutoName):
    """
    CNH: Centered Normality Hypothesis
         X follows a Gaussian law centered around the reference or
         Z follows a Gaussian law centered around 0
    General: No assumption about the distribution of X or Z
    """
    CNH = auto()
    General = auto()
```

### Utils functions

These are utility functions for the general case.

`probability_estimation_general`
allows having an estimation
on the lower bound probability given the sample size.

`minimum_number_of_trials` gives the minimal sample size
required to reach requested `probability` and `confidence`.

```python
probability_estimation_general(success: int, trials: int, confidence: float) -> float
    Computes probability lower bound for Bernouilli process

    This function computes the probability associated with metrics
    computed in the general case (without assumption on the underlying
    distribution). Indeed, in that case the probability is given by the
    sample size with a certain confidence level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    success : int
        Number of success for a Bernoulli experiment
    trials : int
        Number of trials for a Bernoulli experiment
    confidence : float
        Confidence level for the probability lower bound estimation

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The lower bound probability with `confidence` level to have `success` successes for `trials` trials
```

```python

minimum_number_of_trials(probability: float, confidence: float) -> int
    Computes the minimum number of trials to have probability and confidence

    This function computes the minimal sample size required to have
    metrics with a certain probability and confidence for the general case
    (without assumption on the underlying distribution).

    For example, if one wants significant digits with proabability p = 99%
    and confidence (1 - alpha) = 95%, it requires at least 299 observations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    probability : float
        Probability
    confidence : float
        Confidence

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Minimal sample size to have given probability and confidence
