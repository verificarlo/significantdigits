# significantdigits package - v0.3.1

Compute the number of significant digits based on the paper [Confidence Intervals for Stochastic Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09655).
This package is also inspired by the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/interflop/stochastic-confidence-intervals/blob/master/Intervals.ipynb) included with the publication.

## Getting started

This synthetic example illustrates how to compute significant digits
of a results sample with a given known reference:

```python
>>> import significantdigits as sd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from numpy.random import uniform as U
>>> np.random.seed(0)
>>> eps = 2**-52
>>> # simulates results with epsilon differences
>>> X = [1+U(-1,1)*eps for _ in range(10)]
>>> sd.significant_digits(X, reference=1)
>>> 51.02329058847853
```

or with the CLI interface assuming `X` is in `test.txt`:

```bash
> significantdigits --metric significant -i "$(cat test.txt)" --input-format stdin --reference 1
> (51.02329058847853,)
```
If the reference is unknown, one can use the sample average:

```python
...
>>> sd.significant_digits(X, reference=np.mean(X))
>>> 51.02329058847853
```

To print the result as mean +/- error, use the format_uncertainty function:

```python
>>> print(sd.format_uncertainty(X, reference=1))
>>> ['+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000022 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000022 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16'
     '+1.00000000000000000 ± 1.119313369151395181e-16']
```

You can find practical usage patterns, sample data, and step-by-step guides to help you get started or deepen your understanding of the package's features. 

## Advanced Usage

### Inputs types

Functions accept the following types of inputs:
```python
    InputType: ArrayLike
```
Those types are accessible with the `numpy.typing.ArrayLike` type.

### Z computation
Metrics are computed using Z, the distance between the samples and the reference.
There are four possible cases depending on the distance and the nature of the reference that are summarized in this table:

|                    | constant reference (x) | random variable reference (Y) |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Absolute precision | Z = X - x              | Z = X - Y                     |
| Relative precision | Z = X/x - 1            | Z = X/Y - 1                   |


```python
_compute_z(array: InternalArrayType, 
           reference: InternalArrayType | None, 
           error: Error | str, 
           axis: int, 
           shuffle_samples: bool = False) -> InternalArrayType
    Compute Z, the distance between the random variable and the reference

    Compute Z, the distance between the random variable and the reference
    with three cases depending on the dimensions of array and reference:

    X = array
    Y = reference

    Three cases:
    - Y is none
        - The case when X = Y
        - We split X in two and set one group to X and the other to Y
    - X.ndim == Y.ndim
        X and Y have the same dimension
        It it the case when Y is a random variable
    - X.ndim - 1 == Y.ndim or Y.ndim == 0
        Y is a scalar value

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : InternalArrayType
        The random variable
    reference : InternalArrayType | None
        The reference to compare against
    error : Error | str
        The error function to use to compute error between array and reference.
    axis : int, default=0
        The axis or axes along which compute Z
    shuflle_samples : bool, default=False
        If True, shuffles the groups when the reference is None

    Returns
    -------
    array : InternalArrayType
        The result of Z following the error method choose
    scaling_factor : InternalArrayType
        The scaling factor to compute the significant digits
        Useful for absolute error to normalizing the number of significant digits
        ``When Y is a random variable, we choose e = ⎣log_2|E[Y]|⎦+1.``p.10:9

```

### Methods

Two methods exist for computing both significant and contributing digits depending on whether the sample follows a Centered Normal distribution or not.
You can pass the method to the function by using the `Method` enum provided by the package. 
The functions also accept the name as a string
`"cnh"` for `Method.CNH` and `"general"` for `Method.General`.

```python
class Method(AutoName):
    """
    CNH: Centered Normality Hypothesis
         X follows a Gaussian law centered around the reference or
         Z follows a Gaussian law centered around 0
    General: No assumption about the distribution of X or Z
    """
    CNH = auto()
    General = auto()
```

                   reference: ReferenceType | None = None,

### Utils function

These are utility functions for the general case.

#### `probability_estimation_general`

Estimates the lower bound probability given the sample size.


```python
probability_estimation_general(success: int, trials: int, confidence: float) -> float
    Computes probability lower bound for Bernouilli process

    This function computes the probability associated with metrics
    computed in the general case (without assumption on the underlying
    distribution). Indeed, in that case the probability is given by the
    sample size with a certain confidence level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    success : int
        Number of success for a Bernoulli experiment
    trials : int
        Number of trials for a Bernoulli experiment
    confidence : float
        Confidence level for the probability lower bound estimation

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The lower bound probability with `confidence` level to have `success` successes for `trials` trials
```

#### `minimum_number_of_trials`

Returns the minimal sample size required to reach the requested `probability` and `confidence`.


```python
minimum_number_of_trials(probability: float, confidence: float) -> int
    Computes the minimum number of trials to have probability and confidence

    This function computes the minimal sample size required to have
    metrics with a certain probability and confidence for the general case
    (without assumption on the underlying distribution).

    For example, if one wants significant digits with proabability p = 99%
    and confidence (1 - alpha) = 95%, it requires at least 299 observations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    probability : float
        Probability
    confidence : float
        Confidence

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Minimal sample size to have given probability and confidence
```
